Status: Initializing Feature 1. 
Mistakes/Lessons Learned: > * (Empty)
Project Started: 2026-01-17 Status: Task 1 Complete. Moving to Task 2. Mistakes/Lessons Learned: > * Challenge: Simply listing files isn't enough for the LLM to know versions (e.g., Python 3.9 vs 3.11).
Fix: Added a manifest reader to get_context_for_llm that extracts the first 1000 characters of files like requirements.txt or package.json.
Risk: Large zip files could crash memory; used tempfile to keep the disk clean.
Project Started: 2026-01-17 Status: Task 2 Complete. Integrating LiteLLM. Mistakes/Lessons Learned:
Improvement: Switched from vendor-specific SDKs to litellm. This makes the project much more portable for users.
Risk: LLMs often wrap code in triple backticks (```) even when told not to.
Fix: Added _clean_llm_output to sanitize the string before saving it to a file.
Prompt Engineering: Discovered that the LLM needs to be explicitly told to "Copy requirements first" to utilize Docker's layer caching effectively.
Project Started: 2026-01-17 Status: Feature 1 (Architect) Complete. Mistakes/Lessons Learned:
Architecture Decision: Split code into core.py and main.py early to prevent "Spaghetti Code."
Observation: If the ZIP has a nested folder (e.g., zipping a folder vs. zipping files), the WorkspaceManager might need to "find the root" where requirements.txt actually lives.
To-Do for later: Add a "Root Finder" logic if the LLM gets confused by nested directories.
Project Date: 2026-01-18 Status: Feature 2 Finalized. Preparing for Feature 3. Mistakes/Lessons Learned: > * Logic Refactor: Realized that nesting everything in one big try block makes it hard to pinpoint where the failure happened.
Improvement: Split the script into two distinct phases (Phase 1: Architect, Phase 2: Builder). This allows for a "checkpoint" where we have the Dockerfile written before we attempt the build.
Project Date: 2026-01-18 Status: Feature 4 (Validation) added. Mistakes/Lessons Learned:
Challenge: A container might "start" but then crash 2 seconds later because of a missing library.
Fix: Added a time.sleep(10) delay in the test run. If it survives 10 seconds, we assume the entry point is correct.
Risk: Leaving "Zombie Containers" running if the script crashes.
Fix: Used a finally block in test_run to ensure container.stop() and container.remove() are always called.
Project Date: 2026-01-18 Status: Project Complete (v1.0 CLI). Mistakes/Lessons Learned:
UX: Realized that printing too much "raw text" makes it hard to see the status. Added visual separators (===).
CLI Design: Used action="store_true" for the test flag. This is a standard pattern for CLI tools (defaults to testing, skips only if asked).
Final Thought: The "Self-Healing" logic is currently one-shot. In a v2.0, we could make it a while loop that tries up to 3 times before giving up.
Project Date: 2026-01-18 Status: Repository structure finalized. Mistakes/Lessons Learned:
Packaging Pitfall: Initially kept files in the root. Moving to src/ layout makes the project "pip-installable" and follows PEP 517 standards.
Import Errors: Moving files into a subfolder usually breaks imports. Switching to relative imports (from .core ...) fixed the internal linkage.
Project Date: 2026-01-18 Status: Successfully converted to a pip-installable package. Mistakes/Lessons Learned:
Namespace issues: Initially forgot that pip needs to know exactly where the "entry point" is. The [project.scripts] section in pyproject.toml is the bridge between the code and the OS.
Dependency Management: Realized that if gitpython isn't in the dependencies list, the GitHub URL feature will crash for other users.
Editable Mode: Using -e during development is a life-saver; otherwise, you have to re-install every time you fix a typo.
Project Date: 2026-01-18 Status: UX Overhaul. Mistakes/Lessons Learned:
CLI Clarity: Discovered that positional arguments are often confusing if not described well. Added examples to the epilog.
User Feedback: Realized that during the 15-30 seconds the LLM takes to generate code, the user might think the app is frozen. Added rich.status spinners to indicate active processing.
Aesthetics: Added Rich to make error messages appear in bold red, making them much harder to miss.
